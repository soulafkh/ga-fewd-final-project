			<h2>A look inside <em>Arabic for Designers</em></h2>
			<p>The book is divided into six chapters, starting with an historical timeline of written Arabic, from its traditional calligraphic roots to its modern typographical and artistic use.</p>

			<div class="chapters hidden top">
				<div class="two-equal-col left">
					<h3><span class="chapter one">1</span><span itemprop="keywords">Historical Background</span></h3>
					<i class="plus one is-minimised"></i>
					<div class="description clearfix is-hidden">
						<p>The book starts with an historical timeline of the origin of Arabic, the last of the Semitic scripts which historians trace back to the 3rd-century Nabatean script. This chapter reveals gems like the British Library's oldest Qur'an manuscript that dates back to the 8th century, as well as the different calligraphic styles from Naskhi to Kufic.</p>
						<img src="./images/chapter-one-image.png" alt="Historical Background">
					</div>
					</br>
					<h3><span class="chapter two">2</span><span itemprop="keywords">Type design</span></h3>
					<i class="plus two is-minimised"></i>
					<div class="description is-hidden">
						<p>The second chapter lays out a brief chronology of typesetting methods, from the Linotype machine and photographic typesetting to Letraset sheets and OpenType fonts. The author concludes with DecoType's Advanced Composition Engine (ACE), a layout engine which offers a novel solution to complex text rendering for connected scripts such as Arabic.</p>
						<img src="./images/chapter-two-image.png" alt="Type Design">
					</div>
					</br>
					<h3><span class="chapter three">3</span><span itemprop="keywords">Logotype Design</span></h3>
					<i class="plus three is-minimised"></i>
					<div class="description is-hidden">
						<p>In this chapter, the author embarks on a thorough examination of contemporary Arabic typography in a world profoundly informed by Western visual aesthetics. Illustrated examples highlight the bilingual use of Latin and Arabic in design reflecting the rise of globalisation and the proliferation of international companies in the Middle East. The author shows how such cross-hybridisation can yield incredibly innovative results on the one hand or embarrassingly disastrous ones on the other.</p>

				<div class="two-equal-col right">
					<h3><span class="chapter four">4</span>Case Studies</h3>
					<i class="plus four is-minimised"></i>
					<div class="description is-hidden">
						<p>From newspapers to television, the featured case studies highlight the importance of typography to effective communication. Dave Farey gives an in-depth analysis of newspaper layout and typography as he guides the reader through the evolution of <em>The Times</em> of London, from 1932 until today. Boutros also shares his experience with media outlets, and specifically television channels, through various examples, from the new font family for Al-Jazirah newspaper to BBC Arabic's logo and custom font.</p>

					<h3><span class="chapter five">5</span><span itemprop="keywords">Designing with Arabic</span></h3>
					<i class="plus five is-minimised"></i>
					<div class="description is-hidden">
						<p>From calligraphy and logo design to fonts and publications, this chapter forms a gallery of innovative typographic designs.</p>
						<p>The key to successful design, as the author strives to show throughout the book, is a technical and cultural understanding of Arabic as a language and an art form. Designers who merge a hand-made craft with digital technology have a unique skill set, and the marriage of their artistic and technical expertise sparks off distinctively beautiful designs.</p>

					<h3><span class="chapter six">6</span><span itemprop="keywords">Fine Art &amp; Calligraphy</span></h3>
					<i class="plus six is-minimised"></i>
					<div class="description is-hidden">
						<p>The final chapter features artistic collaborations that incorporate Arabic calligraphy into visual media, from paintings to tapestries. These works exemplify how Arabic calligraphy, which evolved during the last millennium and continues to flourish today, has expanded into the realm of contemporary fine art.</p>

					<h3>Mourad Boutros, co-founder and director of Boutros<sup>™</sup>, is an Arabic type designer and calligrapher.</h3>	
					<p>A type designer, Boutros has been a leading figure in the Middle East creative industry since the inception of his company four decades ago. His expertise in Arabic typography and design is unrivalled.</p>
					<p>If you have noticed a bilingual logo, read an Arabic newspaper, watched an Arabic television channel, or looked at an Arabic road sign, they are likely to be a Boutros trademark. From Qatar First Bank and Bosch to Al-Jazirah and  Al-Hayat Newspapers, from BBC Arabic and MBC to the streets of Dubai and Lebanon, his letters are everywhere.</p>
					<p class="readmore"><a href="#">Read more ›</a></p>
					<div class="is-hidden" id="is-hidden">
						<p>As a calligrapher, Boutros's work has found its way into paintings through collaborations with many renowned artists such as Emmanuel Guiragossian. Together, they created a series of oil paintings inspired by the work of Gibran Khalil Gibran and exhibited at the Banqueting House in Whitehall, London in 2010.</p>
						<p>As a writer, as well as <em>Arabic for Designers</em>, Mourad Boutros is also the author of the acclaimed book <em>Talking About Arabic</em> published by Mark Batty in 2009.</p>
